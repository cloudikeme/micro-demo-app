# Mastering Microservices: From Development to Deployment with Kubernetes, Terraform, and Azure

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code for the "Mastering Microservices" tutorial series. We're building a conference application using modern cloud-native technologies.

### Key Features:

- **FrontEnd Service:** Web interface for user interaction
- **C4P Service (Call for Papers):** Manages talk proposal submissions
- **Agenda Service:** Displays conference agenda and manages scheduling
- **Notifications Service:** Sends updates about deadlines and agenda changes
- **PostgreSQL:** Relational data storage for agenda and user data
- **Redis:** In-memory data store for caching
- **Kafka:** Communication layer between services

### Tech Stack:

- **Go (Golang):** For building microservices
- **Docker:** For containerization
- **Kubernetes:** For orchestration and management
- **Terraform:** For provisioning Azure infrastructure
- **Azure:** Cloud platform
- **GitHub Actions:** For CI/CD

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

- **01-part-1:** Contains the code for the first part of the tutorial series
- **02-part-2:** Contains the code for the second part of the tutorial series
- **03-part-3:** Contains the code for the third part of the tutorial series
- **04-part-4:** Contains the code for the fourth part of the tutorial series
- **05-part-5:** Contains the code for the fifth part of the tutorial series



## Conference Application

The `conference-application` folder is the heart of our microservices project. It contains the actual implementation of our conference management system. Here's a breakdown of its structure and contents:
